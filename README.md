# -IOT-BASED-HOME-SECURITY-SYSTEM
This project is designed to develop an affordable and effective home security alarm system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system leverages an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an infrared (IR) sensor module, and a few simple components to detect motion and protect the home from potential intruders. It is a basic, yet efficient motion-sensing alarm that activates a siren whenever movement is detected within a designated area. The purpose of the system is to provide an accessible and cost-effective solution for enhancing home security.
The system operates by utilizing infrared (IR) radiation to detect motion. Human bodies emit heat in the form of infrared light, and the IR sensor module is designed to detect this radiation. The module, which includes two infrared LEDs, emits infrared light into the environment. When a person or object enters the sensor's detection range, the emitted infrared light is reflected off the object and returns to the sensor. This reflected light is detected by the sensor, which then sends a signal to the Arduino Uno for processing. If movement is detected, the Arduino triggers a buzzer to sound an alarm, notifying the homeowner of the potential intrusion.
The software for this project is relatively simple, running on the Arduino Uno. The program continuously monitors the IR sensor for any changes in its status. If the sensor detects infrared radiation—indicating that a person has moved within its range—the Arduino processes the data and sends a signal to activate the buzzer. This provides an immediate audible alert, notifying the homeowner of a possible security breach.
In conclusion, this IoT-based home security system offers an affordable, efficient, and reliable way to secure a home from unauthorized entry. By using a basic motion-sensing IR sensor, the system can detect intruders and trigger a loud alarm to alert the homeowner. The project is easy to assemble, cost-effective, and can be powered either by a battery or USB connection, making it a practical solution for home security needs. This project is also an excellent introduction to working with sensors, embedded systems, and IoT technology.
